# JokesApp

Why: To practice architectures and familiarize myself with REST API, practice making API calls. 

What: VERY VERY basic jokes app with Zero View, ONE View model and ONE VC. 

How: 

1. ViewModel is a Singleton, handles logic for making API calls. 
2. Not using a view because I am using XIB files for UI
3. VC holds all the other stuff :)
