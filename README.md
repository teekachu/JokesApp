# JokesApp

Why: To practice MVVM architectures and REST API. 

What: VERY VERY basic jokes app with Zero View, ONE View model and ONE VC. 

How: 
1. ViewModel is a Singleton, handles logic for making API calls. 
2. Not using a view because I am using XIB files for UI
3. VC holds all the other stuff that are not logic :)
